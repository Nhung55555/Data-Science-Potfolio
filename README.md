####  Car Sales (Data Analysis and Visualisation, Python)
- This project employed various statistical techniques on a real-world dataset. The project
began with descriptive statistics on "Kms_Driven", analyzing central tendency, dispersion, 
and IQR to identify outliers. These outliers were then removed. Normality testing revealed 
non-normality, prompting a Box-Cox transformation. The analysis identified a square root 
transformation as the optimal approach for normalization. Next, confidence intervals were 
constructed for the population mean of "Kms_Driven" at various confidence levels. This was 
followed by hypothesis testing to evaluate claims about the mean. Finally, a simple linear 
regression model was employed to investigate the relationship between “Kms_Driven”, 
“Age”, “Present_Price” (independent variable) and “Selling_Price” (dependent variable).
 By applying these statistical methods in sequence, the project reinforced understanding of 
data analysis for real-world scenarios. It served as a valuable exercise in revisiting core 
statistical concepts and demonstrating their practical relevance in the field of information 
technology, where data analysis plays a critical role.
