####  Car Sales (Data Analysis and Visualisation, Python)
- This project employed various statistical techniques on a real-world dataset. The project
began with descriptive statistics on "Kms_Driven", analyzing central tendency, dispersion, 
and IQR to identify outliers. These outliers were then removed. Normality testing revealed 
non-normality, prompting a Box-Cox transformation. The analysis identified a square root 
transformation as the optimal approach for normalization. Next, confidence intervals were 
constructed for the population mean of "Kms_Driven" at various confidence levels. This was 
followed by hypothesis testing to evaluate claims about the mean. Finally, a simple linear 
regression model was employed to investigate the relationship between “Kms_Driven”, 
“Age”, “Present_Price” (independent variable) and “Selling_Price” (dependent variable).
 By applying these statistical methods in sequence, the project reinforced understanding of 
data analysis for real-world scenarios. It served as a valuable exercise in revisiting core 
statistical concepts and demonstrating their practical relevance in the field of information 
technology, where data analysis plays a critical role.
### Parking Booking Project (Python, MySQL)
- A project using Netbeans combined with MySQL to build an application about parking reservation for customers. The project help customers to reserve a parking space online, when the customers sign in, they may view the car number, parking lot, and other information on the customers’ online parking process. Firstly, customers must sign in with their username and the password they have made. Customers may access their car number, slot number, lot number, date, due date, and booking status when their identity has been verified. To help them determine if the date they wish to select is still available, the information will mostly be presented in a table. The consumers are able to view the complete cost of their reservation after selecting the suitable date. After that, customers may visit the Payment Method Page and select the appropriate payment option.
